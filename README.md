# DM BIKE

## Research overview
The purpose of this analysis was to explore a successful bike-sharing venture to learn more about the customer base and other consumer patterns. While CitiBike operates in a highly different built and demogrpahic environment, we may be able to use this initial fact-finding to further assess the potential of this transportation mode in Des Moines.
